# RubyOnFails

**The framework that fails so I and possibly YOU can learn.**

RubyOnFails is a minimal implementation of a Ruby web framework. It is being built from scratch to deconstruct and understand the "magic" behind Ruby on Rails.
Think of yourself as Gandalf. In Middle-earth, you are not merely a conjurer, but a **Maia** sent by the **Valar**. To wield your power effectively, you need a conduit.
- **Ruby is your Staff:** The fundamental tool that channels your will.
- **Rails is your Magic:** The powerful spells that shape the world.
A wizard does not simply wave their hands! they must understand the tool they wield. This project is about understanding the staff so **I** (or you) can master the magic.
  
This project follows the path laid out in Noah Gibbs' book, *Rebuilding Rails*, reconstructing a Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture to learn about:
- Rack and HTTP requests
- Metaprogramming and Ruby internals
- Routing and Controllers
- ORMs and Database interactions
